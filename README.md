Android-User-Profiles
=====================

Creating an app (python-based) that will allow a user to switch user profiles

GOALS
=====
1) Use SL4A - Python

2) Enable multiple user profiles on android (device agnostic)
	
	a) probably need backend database for profile handling... we'll see...

3) Figure out installer package so that SL4A does not need to be installed
	
	a) initial research show that when packaged it will do this

4) Figure out if root is required (probably)

5) GUI the project

6) ??? <- 6 and on will come in the future
