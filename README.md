Android-User-Profiles
=====================

Creating an app (python-based) that will allow a user to switch user profiles

GOALS
=====
1) Use SL4A - Python
2) Enable multiple user profiles on android (device agnostic)
3) Figure out installer package so that SL4A does not need to be installed
4) Figure out if root is required (probably)
5) GUI the project
6) ??? <- 6 and on will come in the future
